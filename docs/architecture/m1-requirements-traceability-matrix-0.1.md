# fNx M1 Requirements Traceability Matrix 0.1

**Date:** 2026-11-07  
**Status:** Working traceability baseline; identifiers are stable within this document, but requirements remain proposals until their source contracts are ratified.

## 1. Purpose and rules

This matrix connects architectural obligations to their current proposal sections and the evidence needed to verify them. It is not a substitute for normative specification text and does not promote a recommendation into a ratified requirement.

Requirement identifiers use these domains:

- `ISA`: instruction set, opcode namespace, and encoding.
- `CTX`: workspace, thread, and execution-context lifecycle.
- `MEM`: address translation, memory, ordering, and atomics.
- `EXC`: exceptions, traps, interrupts, and reset.
- `FAB`: fabric, endpoints, and backplanes.
- `CTRL`: FCP, platform management, and cross-domain authority.
- `CONF`: conformance profiles, evidence, and verification process.

A requirement's **proposal** status means the behavior is identified as necessary or recommended but has not been ratified. **Open** means a normative choice is still required. **Test pending** means the proposal identifies evidence, but no executable test is yet claimed.

### Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Proposal | Contract direction exists; not ratified |
| Open | Architectural choice or exact semantics remain unresolved |
| Test pending | Required verification has not yet been implemented |
| Research | Evidence or quantitative evaluation is still needed |

No row in this initial matrix should be read as proof of implementation or conformance.

## 2. ISA and opcode requirements

| ID | Requirement / obligation | Source | Verification evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| ISA-002 | A numeric opcode identity has one global semantic meaning wherever directly representable. | opcode namespace §§2–4 | Registry uniqueness and cross-member semantic equivalence tests | Proposal |
| ISA-003 | An implementation must not truncate, alias, or silently reinterpret an opcode outside its N-bit representable range. | opcode namespace §§3, 6 | Negative assembler, decoder, and runtime tests at N-bit boundaries | Proposal |
| ISA-004 | Unassigned, assigned-but-unsupported, malformed, and privilege-prohibited instructions remain distinguishable. | opcode namespace §6; exception model §3.3 | Golden vectors asserting distinct architectural outcomes | Open |

## 3. Workspace and execution-context requirements

| ID | Requirement / obligation | Source | Verification evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CTX-001 | Workspace, hardware thread, and address space are distinct architectural entities; workspace is not inherently an OS process or address space. | workspace/thread §2 | Reference-model entity and ownership tests | Proposal |

## 5. Exception, interrupt, and reset requirements

| ID | Requirement / obligation | Source | Verification evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| CTRL-010 | Debug and FCP management access cannot implicitly bypass CPU memory protection, workspace isolation, or DMA protection. | privilege/authority §§3.4–3.5, 6 | Debug/FCP privilege-bypass negative tests | Proposal |

## 8. Conformance and evidence requirements

| ID | Requirement / obligation | Source | Verification evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONF-001 | Conformance is reported by domain and exact member width, revision, and capability profile; a single vague compatibility label is insufficient. | conformance strategy §§2–3, 9 | Profile validator and report-schema tests | Proposal |
| CONF-002 | Every normative requirement maps to one or more positive tests, negative tests where applicable, expected outcomes, and evidence status. | conformance strategy §4 | Matrix-to-test manifest consistency check | Test pending |

## 9. Cross-contract invariants requiring explicit reconciliation

These invariants span multiple proposals and must be resolved once, not independently redefined in each document.

1. **Atomicity boundary:** workspace shared-register visibility (CTX-005), memory atomic scope (MEM-009), and fabric atomic transactions (FAB-005) must use compatible scopes and completion semantics. A shared register must not be described as atomic at system scope unless the underlying implementation contract guarantees that scope.
2. **Completion versus visibility:** fabric completion (FAB-003) must be reconciled with memory ordering and visibility (MEM-008, MEM-010). A completed transport response is not automatically a globally visible store unless the memory model says so.
3. **Interrupts and in-flight work:** exception delivery (EXC-006, EXC-007), context teardown (CTX-009), and fabric retry/duplicate suppression (FAB-007) must agree on ownership of outstanding operations.
4. **Authority separation:** CPU privilege, workspace protection, delegated capabilities, debug authority, host OS authority, and FCP control authority (EXC-009, CTRL-003, CTRL-005, CTRL-007–CTRL-010) must form one explicit authority model. FCP control privileges must not silently grant application-memory access.
5. **Address and fabric domains:** N-bit virtual addresses (MEM-001), physical address width (MEM-002), DMA protection (MEM-010), and fabric address domains (FAB-002, FAB-009) must be connected by explicit translation and authorization rules.
6. **Identity lifecycle:** generation-safe workspace/thread identities (CTX-003), address-space identifiers (MEM-005), endpoint identities (FAB-008), and management inventory identifiers must define reuse and stale-reference behavior consistently.
7. **Reset and teardown:** reset scope (EXC-008), workspace/thread teardown (CTX-006, CTX-009), and partial fabric hierarchy failure (FAB-008) must define which operations are drained, aborted, retried, or reported as indeterminate.

## 10. Recommended implementation order

1. Ratify vocabulary and entity boundaries: CPU unit, hardware thread, workspace, address space, endpoint, backplane, FCP.
2. Resolve cross-contract invariants 1–7 above, starting with atomicity/completion and authority.
3. Select address representation, byte order, alignment, and baseline memory consistency rules.
4. Specify exception entry/return, pending interrupt retention, and reset scopes.
5. Specify endpoint identity, transaction completion, retry safety, and hierarchy behavior.
6. Freeze the requirement IDs and add machine-readable test-manifest metadata.
7. Implement a small reference model and deterministic tests before assigning opcode values or claiming conformance.
